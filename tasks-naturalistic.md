# Naturalistic Memory Tasks (ses-19 to ses-28)

Movie-watching and free recall paradigm. During encoding, participants watch
movie clips. During retrieval, participants verbally recall what they remember
(audio recorded via microphone).

| Current label | Planned label | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `task-encoding` | `task-NATencoding` | Movie viewing |
| `task-retrieval` | `task-NATretrieval` | Verbal free recall (audio recorded) |
| `task-math` | `task-NATmath` | Math distractor task |
| `task-resting` | `task-NATresting` | Resting state between task blocks |

## Movie Viewing
- Watched 8 films of 2-6 minutes each
- Types of movies: various length and style (live-action, animated, stop motion, with or without speech)
- Conditions: 6 of the movies are new and 2 are repeated every session
- Participants are first shown the movie title for 2.5 seconds and then shown the movie.

## Free Recall
- Participants are prompted with a movie title for 7.5 seconds. During this time, the participant indicates if they are able to recall the movie associated with the title.
- If they are unable to recall the movie, they are then shown an image cue for 3 seconds.
- A fixation cross is then shown, and the participant speaks freely into a microphone for an unlimited amount of time to recall as many details as possible from the movie.
- Conditions: 4 are from that current session previously shown in the encoding task, 2 are repeated every session, and 2 are from the previous session.
