# Final Sessions (ses-29 and ses-30)

## Final Free Recall (ses-29)
- Outside the scanner behavioral task ~2 weeks after the last naturalistic task.
- Participants were asked to recall as many details as possible about the entire experiment.

## Final Memory Tests (ses-30)

Session 30 contains final memory tests that will receive unique task IDs (to be
determined). It may also include makeup localizer runs.

### Final Cued Recall
- Participant had 4 runs of a final cued recall session, the same as in the trial-based task, in which the participant was given either the word or image cue, and were instructed to recall the image or word that they saw during the 15 previous cued recall scans.

### Final Temporal Memory
- Participants were given a continuous scale and asked to select when they initially saw that pair during the encoding condition.

### Final 2-AFC
- Across all 15 previous trial-based tasks.
