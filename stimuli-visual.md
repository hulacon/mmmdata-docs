# Visual Stimuli: Shared1000

- **Source**: Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) shared images
  (see [NSD Experiments documentation](https://cvnlab.slite.page/p/NKalgWd__F/Experiments))
- **Count**: 1,000 images (in `images/` subdirectory)
- **Format**: PNG
- **Naming**: `shared{NNNN}_nsd{NNNNN}.png`
  — `shared` index (1-based, zero-padded to 4 digits) + original NSD image ID
- **Selection**: These are the 1,000 images designated as "shared" in the NSD
  experiment (shown to all NSD participants). Selection criteria and image
  properties are documented by the NSD group.
- **Licensing**: TBD — follows NSD data sharing terms

## Image Metadata

`nsd_stim_info.csv` contains metadata for the full NSD stimulus set (73,000
images). Rows where `shared1000=True` correspond to the images used in this
study.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| (index) | 0-based row index |
| `cocoId` | MS-COCO image ID |
| `cocoSplit` | MS-COCO dataset split (e.g., `val2017`) |
| `cropBox` | Crop coordinates used to extract the stimulus from the original image |
| `loss` | NSD loss metric for the image |
| `nsdId` | NSD image ID — matches the `_nsd{NNNNN}` portion of the PNG filename |
| `flagged` | Whether the image was flagged in NSD |
| `BOLD5000` | Whether the image appears in the BOLD5000 dataset |
| `shared1000` | **True** for images in this study's stimulus set |

## COCO Annotations

All 1,000 shared images originate from the MS-COCO `train2017` split. COCO
annotations (captions and object instances) have been extracted for these images
and stored in two CSV files.

**`coco_annotations.csv`** — one row per image (1,000 rows):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `nsdId` | NSD image ID (links to filenames and `nsd_stim_info.csv`) |
| `cocoId` | MS-COCO image ID |
| `caption_1` through `caption_5` | Five human-written captions from COCO |
| `object_categories` | Semicolon-separated list of COCO object categories detected in the image |
| `object_counts` | Category:count pairs (e.g., `person:3; dog:1`) |
| `supercategories` | Semicolon-separated COCO supercategories (e.g., `animal; person`) |
| `n_object_instances` | Total number of annotated object instances |
| `n_unique_categories` | Number of distinct object categories |

**`coco_captions.csv`** — one row per caption (5,000+ rows):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `nsdId` | NSD image ID |
| `cocoId` | MS-COCO image ID |
| `caption_index` | Caption number (1–5) |
| `caption` | The caption text |

These files were generated by `scripts/extract_coco_metadata.py` from the
official COCO `annotations_trainval2017` release. The 80 COCO object categories
span supercategories including person, vehicle, outdoor, animal, accessory,
sports, kitchen, food, furniture, electronic, appliance, and indoor.
